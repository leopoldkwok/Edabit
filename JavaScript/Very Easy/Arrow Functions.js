// Arrow Functions
// In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.

// Write five adder functions:

// add2(x) should return 2 + x.
// add3(x) should return 3 + x.
// add5(x) should return 5 + x.
// add7(x) should return 7 + x.
// add11(x) should return 11 + x.
// Tips
// Functions that consists only of a return, can be written as oneliner with an arrow function.

// For example, the code:

// function areSame(a, b) {
//     return a == b;
// }
// Can be simplified to:

// areSame = (a, b) => a == b;
// Bonus
// (a, b) => a == b is technically an anonymous function. However, it can be assigned to the identifier areSame and it can then be called using areSame().

add2 = (x) => x + 2;

add3 = (x) => x + 3;

add5 = (x) => x + 5;

add7 = (x) => x + 7;

add11 = (x) => x + 11;
